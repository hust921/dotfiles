HUBIC(1)                                                                                                              HUBIC(1)



NAME
       hubic - keep your files synchronized with the hubiC cloud service.

SYNOPSIS
       hubic COMMAND [OPTIONS] [PARAMETERS]

DESCRIPTION
       hubiC can sync a local directory with your cloud storage account: it keeps track of any modifications on your local
       computer or remote account and replicates them on the other end, so you can access your data anywhere.

       This tool allows you to interact with the background synchronization process. The background process is started
       automatically when you login in or when a command is sent. If you want to disable automatic startup, go to the startup
       applications in your desktop environment to disable it (on GNOME: gnome-session-properties).

       You need a hubiC account to use this service. If you don’t have one, you can get a 25 GB account for free at
       https://hubic.com. The hubiC service is subjet to the General Conditions of Use
       (https://hubic.com/en/contracts/Contrat_hubiC_2013.pdf).

           Important
           This command requires a D-Bus session to work properly, see SERVER USAGE for more info.

BACKUP
       Backup feature come in addition to synchronization. Unlike synchronized folders, only one computer is allowed to modify
       the backup. This means that you can only read content of backup from other applications.

       Each time a backup is 'update’d the new local content is uploaded. Depending on versioning settings, overwritten files
       may be versioned. Deleted files may be kept or deleted (note that under versioning, the file will still exist and will
       be only masked).

       The versioning feature keep older versions of files. You can keep only the Nth last versions, in this case, the oldest
       versions are deleted.

       A backup is attached to one client and only that client is allowed to update it. You can attach a backup to another
       client but you have to make sure that the previous one will not update it again (the behavior is not defined in that
       case). Such cases includes switch to a new or formatted computer.

COMMANDS
   start
       Starts the synchronization process and logs in (if an account has been registered). If syncing is already running, it
       does nothing.

   stop
       Kills the synchronization process. Please note that it will be restarted automatically as soon as an application calls
       it.

   login [--exclude=PATH] [--password_path=PATH] [--] email [sync_dir]
       Connects client to an existing account identified by email.

       The password will be requested. You can also provide the --password_path with a file containing only the password.

       If you want to enable synchronization, you must provide sync_dir which points to the path to synchronize (absolute or
       relative path). If sync_dir is not provided, the application will run in backup-only mode.

       Some folders can be optionally excluded from syncing by selecting --exclude options (this can be used multiple times to
       exclude several directories).

           Note
           Once logged, your credentials will be kept in application settings so you usually don’t need to log in again. Just
           use the start command.

   logout
       Disconnects the account that is currently logged in.

           Note
           this command should not be used to pause synchronization temporarily then resume it, use the pause and resume
           commands for this. The reason being that it clears the local cache, which can be resource-consuming next time you
           connect.

   pause
       Pauses synchronization and interrupts any actions in progress. Account must be logged in to perform this command.

   resume
       Resume synchronization. Account must be logged in to perform this command.

   synchronize
       Triggers an instant synchronization cycle. Account must be logged in to perform this command.

   status
       Displays information on the account and running operations. Can be combined with the watch command to keep track of
       status.

   syncdir [--none] [path]
       Without path, displays the current synchronised directory. When path is provided and points to an existing directory,
       changes synchronized directory (any actions in progress are aborted immediately).

       To disable synchronization, just pass the --none flag (exclusive with path).

       Account must be logged in to perform this command.

   config [option_name [new_value]]
       Without any parameter, all variables and their values are displayed. With option_name only, the corresponding value is
       displayed. With both option_name and option_value, the value is changed to the new one. Known options are:

       AllowBugReporting
           Whether automated bug reports are sent for unexpected errors.

       DownloadSpeedLimit
           Maximum download speed in bytes per second (0 means unlimited).

       UploadSpeedLimit
           Maximum upload speed in bytes per second (0 means unlimited).

       UseRecycleBin
           Whether locally deleted files are placed in recycle bin or deleted directly.

       TimeBetweenSynchronization
           Interval between two complete synchronization cycles in minutes.

   proxy set hostname port [username [password_path]]
       Installs given proxy configuration for communicating with hubiC servers. This overwrites any previous proxy settings.

       If proxy needs authentication, username must be provided, the password is handled in the same way as with login (either
       interactively asked, or uses the provided file).

   proxy unset
       Reset proxy configuration and uses direct Internet access.

   publish path
       Publish a new file or folder and publish the public URL. The path must be inside the synchronized directory and must
       already be sent to the remote storage.

       Account must be logged in to perform this command.

   publish list
       Displays a list of all currently published files and their download URL. Account must be logged in to perform this
       command.

   unpublish path
       Unpublish a published file or folder. The path must point to a file or folder that has already been published. Account
       must be logged in to perform this command.

   exclude list
       Displays all excluded folders (absolute path).

   exclude add path
       Adds path to excluded folders. The path can be either relative or absolute and does not have to exist (in this case it
       will not be synced when created).

   exclude remove path
       Removes path from excluded folders, synchronizing it again.

   exclude clear
       Removes all excluded folders, synchronizing all files and folders.

   backup create [--name=NAME] [--frequency=FREQUENCY] [kept_versions=VERSIONS] [--keep_deleted|--drop_deleted] [--] path
       Creates a new backup using directory pointed by path. All content inside this directory will be uploaded to hubiC. See
       BACKUP for more information.

       Backup NAME will be inferred from path (folder name) if it is not provided.

       The FREQUENCY controls the automatic backup scheduling. It must be one of the following: never (default, only manual
       backups), hourly, daily, weekly.

       The VERSIONS controls how many old versions of files are kept. It must be an integer. The default value is -1, which
       means to keep all versions, without limit. The value 0 disables the versioning.

       The --keep_deleted and --drop_deleted are exclusive and controls the behavior of the application when a file is
       deleted. The --keep_deleted (default) do not delete file on hubiC, no matter what the versioning setting is. The
       --drop_deleted will delete file on hubiC, if versioning is enabled file will be simply masked by default, but older
       versions will be sill available.

   backup info
       Prints some informations about all backups.

   backup update path_or_name
       Triggers an update of a backup, the argument may be its name or its local path. The backup must be attached.

   backup config [--keep_deleted] [--drop_deleted] [--path=NEW_PATH] [--frequency=FREQUENCY] [--kept_versions=VERSIONS] [--]
       path_or_name
       Change configuration of the backup. All options are optional, only provided options are changed. The options have the
       same meaning as backup create command.

       Note that if the path is changed, the new path becomes the reference. That means that any file which exists on hubiC
       but not in new folder will be possibly deleted.

   backup download backup_path_or_name target_path
       Downloads an entire backup to target_path (which must be an empty folder). The backup does not need to be attached.

   backup attach name path
       Attach the backup name to the local path provided. Before using this command be sure that the previously attached
       computer will not update it again. See BACKUP for more details.

       The content of given folder will become the reference content, so any file which exists on hubiC but not in the path
       will be deleted. You may want to download the backup before 'attach’ing it.

   backup delete [--force] path_or_name
       Deletes a backup and all attached files. A confirmation will be prompted if the session is interactive, unless --force
       flag is provided. The backup does not need to be attached.

   main-loop [--verbose] [--debug]
       Starts the syncing loop in the foreground and prints log to standard output. This is not usually required except for
       debugging purposes. The --verbose and --debug options adds some more messages.

       This command will fail if the background synchronization process is already running.

TROUBLESHOOTING
       In case of issues with synchronization, you may find more information about what is going on in logs, they are located
       in ~/.config/hubiC/application.log.

       You can also get support on https://hubic.com/en/faq.

       This software is still at beta stage, please report any issue you may encounter.

SERVER USAGE
       As this program require a D-Bus session to run, running it on headless configurations such as servers or NAS machines
       may need some tweaking.

       You need to set the DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable to run hubiC. This variable is not usually set if you
       have opened your session with tools such as SSH.

       To start a new session bus and run hubiC, you can either use dbus-launch:

           $ dbus-launch --sh-syntax
           DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:abstract=/tmp/dbus-XXXX,guid=XXXXXXX
           DBUS_SESSION_BUS_PID=1234
           $ export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:abstract=/tmp/dbus-XXXX,guid=XXXXXXX
           $ hubic login foo@bar.com ~/hubiC

       If dbus-launch is not installed, you can also use dbus-deamon directly:

           $ dbus-daemon --session --fork --print-address
           unix:abstract=/tmp/dbus-XXXX,guid=XXXXXXX
           $ export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:abstract=/tmp/dbus-XXXX,guid=XXXXXXX
           $ hubic login me@foo.com ~/hubiC

       Once synchronization has started, it will continue to run even after the session is closed. To interact with it from
       another session, you need to set the DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS to the same value as before:

           $ export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:abstract=/tmp/dbus-XXXX,guid=XXXXXXX
           $ hubic status

       Do not start another session bus or you will have two hubiC services running!

KNOWN ISSUES
       ·   Trash can handling has not yet been implemented. It will be implemented in a later version
